# BackDataPassingThroughClosures App  

**BackDataPassingThroughClosures** is a simple iOS application built using Swift and UIKit. This project demonstrates the implementation of backward data passing between view controllers using closures.  

# Features ->  

- **Data Passing:** Pass data seamlessly from the second view controller back to the first view controller using closures.  
- **User Input Handling:** Collect user data (first name, last name, and password) through text fields on the second screen.  
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Automatically update the labels on the first screen with the data passed back.
